            My name is Bertilia Cadet. I was born  and raised in Port au Prince, Haiti.  I have been married for twenty one years to my loving husband Fenol Cadet. I am a mother of four children Jochebed, Jephthe, Joaddan, and Joscheba Cadet. We are very happy family, and Godly purpose way, to make different in our community. 

At the age of 15, I became a born again Christian since 1986. I am presently a twenty four year member of the Holiness Church of God of Bethlehem directed by Pastor Fadinel Tremont.  As a kingdom worker, I am involved in various church activities such as Sunday school teaching, the Relief Ministry and event planning as well as helping in different departments as much I can. 

I am a very loving and friendly person. I have a passion for helping other people, especially when they are in need. This passion to help others and Godâ€™s purpose for me has gained me the opportunity to have a leadership position in the Relief Ministry, where we organize food and clothing drives, and health fairs to help not only those in our community but the homeless and poor in Washington D.C.

In addition to my work for the Lord, I graduated from Lancaster Bible College obtaining a Bachelor of Science in Bible. My ambition is to preach the gospel; and share the good news of Jesus Christ on air that millions people can hear, and receive Jesus Christ as their savior, so that the kingdom of God can grow, and the kingdom of Satan can diminish. Amen! Hallelujah!  Glory to the Lord our God.     

I am currently a licensed Practical Nurse, practicing in Maryland and Washington D.C., but I plan to be able to preach the gospel full time through the medium of radio.
